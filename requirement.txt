Write a Python 3 script using FastAPI that exposes a POST API endpoint `/extract-imei/` where a user uploads a file (PDF or image). The API should:

1. Accept a single file upload using FastAPI's UploadFile.
2. If the file is a PDF:
   - Try to extract text using `pdfplumber`.
   - If that fails or returns empty, fallback to OCR by converting PDF pages to images using `pdf2image` and running `pytesseract` on each page.
3. If the file is an image (JPG, PNG, etc.), run OCR using `pytesseract` and `Pillow`.
4. Search the extracted text for **15-digit numbers** using regex, and validate them using the **Luhn algorithm** to check if they're valid IMEI numbers.
5. Return a JSON response with all valid IMEIs found in the text.

Add logging using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module:
- Log each upload with filename.
- Log whether it was parsed with `pdfplumber` or OCR.
- Log number of characters extracted and IMEIs found.
- Log to both console and a file named `imei_extractor.log`.

Ensure the API includes OpenAPI docs and can be run using `uvicorn`. Also include instructions on required Python packages and system dependencies (like `tesseract-ocr`, `poppler-utils`).

Make the script clean, modular, and production-ready.
